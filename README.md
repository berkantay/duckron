<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Originally created to streamline the management of local DuckDB databases, this project offers a powerful, easy-to-use toolset for handling database backups, setting retention policies, and monitoring database health metrics, such as file size and integrity. What started as a focused utility for DuckDB quickly expanded to support broader database management needs on local systems.

With an emphasis on automation and simplicity, this tool is ideal for developers and data engineers seeking reliable, hassle-free local database maintenance. By centralizing core management functions, it reduces manual overhead, enhances database reliability, and ensures data safety with minimal configuration.
